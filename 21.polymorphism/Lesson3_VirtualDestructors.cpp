Lesson 3: Virtual Destructors

When using polymorphism, the destructor of the base class should be declared
as virtual. This ensures that when you delete a derived object through a base
class pointer, the derived classâ€™s destructor is called, properly cleaning up
resources.

This lesson demonstrates the importance of virtual destructors.
