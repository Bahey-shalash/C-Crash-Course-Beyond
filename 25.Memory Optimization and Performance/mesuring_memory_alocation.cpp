/*
    Measuring memory allocation in C++: 
    ------------------------------------

    In C++, there is no direct *built-in* function to check the total memory allocation used by a program. However, we can track memory allocation in various ways. This is crucial for optimizing performance and detecting memory leaks (fuites de m√©moire).

    Here are some methods to monitor memory allocation in C++:
    
    1. **Overloading the new and delete operators**:
       We can track memory allocations by overriding the global `new` and `delete` operators to log the size of each allocation and deallocation.
    
    2. **Using a memory profiling tool**:
       Tools like Valgrind (Linux), AddressSanitizer (Clang, GCC), or Visual Studio's built-in profiler (Windows) can give detailed reports on memory usage, including peak memory, allocations, and leaks.

    3. **Standard Library Containers**:
       Some STL containers (like `std::vector` or `std::string`) offer methods such as `.capacity()` or `.size()` which give indirect information about their memory usage. 

    4. **Custom tracking with malloc hooks**:
       For lower-level malloc-based allocation tracking (C-style), one can override `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free` to intercept calls and track them.

    Below, I will illustrate the approach of overloading `new` and `delete` operators for tracking heap allocations. This technique will allow us to monitor how much memory has been allocated and deallocated, giving insights into the program's memory footprint.
